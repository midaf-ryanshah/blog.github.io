Hello everyone. Thanks for checking out the blog. 

If you're here, I assume you have heard about, or are interested in what Mid AF Technologies is or what we have to offer. So first things first, welcome. I hope you enjoy your stay.

My internet handle is Midafir (or Mid for short) - I'm one of four people who helped give birth to Mid AF Technologies.

Mid AF Technologies has existed in a few various different forms over the years, but I strongly believe this is the final incarnation of a burning desire that has been driving myself and the others since the idea first came across our minds.

I'm sure you have a tonne of questions; who am I, what are we doing it, why call yourselves Mid AF Technologies? These are all great questions. We'll answer them all in time, I'm sure.

More importantly; today, I wanted to talk about what this blog is. It's not unheard of for a professional video-game studio to have a blog but this one feels a bit more... rudimentary. That is by design.

The idea behind this blog is to help show that they're are real humans behind Mid AF and our projects. In an industry such as this, communication between fans and creators is in a very strange place indeed. Most people have tended to shy away from communicating, others ensure all communication is robotic and one-way; I (clearly) don't want that, hence the blog.

What exactly the blog is, I'm unsure at this time. For the time being, I envision using this blog to communicate with you about the development of our upcoming projects in a way that isn't appropriate for the usual channels. This is a more "ties undone, whiskey glass in hand end-of-day" kind of blog.

My main form of communication is still going to be via the experiences we create. If I feel strongly about wanting to say something, that's for the creative outlets to help broadcast to the world. Instead, this is more of the back-stage cigarette break blog, where we discuss what really goes into putting the Mid AF into the Mid AF experiences. 

Making games, even with a large team, can be a very isolating experience. Sometimes, you need a programmer duck or sanity checker to stand by your side as you go down the incredibly stressful and mad endeveaor of creating games. That's what I hope for you - I hope you'll sit there by my side during the long nights and the early mornings, hearing me out as I show you what really goes into creating games.

Naturally, there's borders on what I can and can't discuss on here. That much is a given. NDA's, business deals and everything are a massive no-go here. There will also be elements of our titles I can't discuss (spoiler wise .etc). But that won't stop me inviting you on our journey, through the ups and downs and showing you as much as a I humanly can of how a studio like Mid AF operates.

Hopefully now you get a rough idea of what I want to do with this blog. Essentially, think of a couple of mates sharing a pint after work discussing some of the interesting adventures in game development. Think of it as your indirect line to the Mid AF Technologies CEO. If it all goes to shit or doesn't work, then at least I can say I gave it a shot. I really hope you find some enjoyment or useful information here.

Before we go, I just want to give you a little bit about myself. I always struggle to talk about myself but if you're to go on this wild ride with me / us, then I guess it would make sense to know who you're on the adventure with.

As I said, my internet handle is Midafir, often shortened to Mid. I've been a professional game developer for over 12 years now in the AAA industry. Previously, I've worked on some of your favourite games. At this time, due to NDAs, I can't give you a specific list, but if you're thinking your Fortnite's and your Grand Theft Auto's then you're not too far off at all.

I first entered the industry as a software engineer, a fancy name for a game programmer. At some point on that journey, I answered my true calling as a Technical Designer and I've been a AAA Designer (both Technical and game) ever since.

Mid AF Technologies is the culmination of many years of having some of those good ideas that it wasn't quite the right time for. Well, the time is now. Mid AF has been born and I hope we'll look back at this point in many years time and be astounded at how far it went.

In this blog, I'll answer as much as I can, but there is one question you'll 100% never get a serious answer to; "what does the AF mean in Mid AF?". If you ask this, I warn you now, you'll always get a different answer.

So that's all for the first blog post. If you read this far, thank-you. As previously mentioned, I'll talk to you as often as I can and as much as I can. I hope in some form I'm able to entertain, delight, educate. Whatever. Not quite sure what's going to happen. Just like most things in life, this is an experiment but I'm excited to get stuck in.

Have a good morning, evening, noon or night, or whatever it is where you are and I'll see you in the next post.

Cheers,
Midafir.
